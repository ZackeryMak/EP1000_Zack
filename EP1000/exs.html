                	<h2>CAD Exercises</h2>

                    <p>For these first 2 exercises, we were tasked to recreate the designs shown below with specific dimensions and constraints in 2D. This served as a warmup to get us used to the software so that we would be competent enough to move on to more difficult designs. We used only the sketch feature and made use of line sketches, circle sketches, rectangle sketches, polygon sketches as well as the measurement feature.</p>

                      <p>For this Exercise, I used the slot sketch feature to draw the slot in the middle of the design and the fillet feature to draw the small curves connecting the circles.</p>

                     <p>The next exercise was our first exercise where we did a 3D model. This was done by using the extrude feature after a finishing a sketch to the dimensions that are desired.
